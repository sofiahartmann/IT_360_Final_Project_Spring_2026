## Project Idea
This project involves developing a Python-based digital forensics tool that scans a directory of evidence files and automatically extracts file system and embedded metadata. The tool outputs the collected metadata in a structured format to assist investigators with timeline reconstruction and preliminary evidence analysis.
### Target Selection:
The tool targets local file systems or a specified directory containing digital evidence files collected during an investigation.
### Artifact Selection:
The tool focuses on extracting file system metadata (creation, modification, and access times) and embedded metadata from common file types such as images, PDFs, and document files (author, software used, timestamps).
### Implementation Language:
The tool will be implemented in Python, using standard libraries and lightweight third-party modules for metadata extraction.
### Output Format:
The extracted metadata will be exported in CSV format for easy analysis and sorting.
